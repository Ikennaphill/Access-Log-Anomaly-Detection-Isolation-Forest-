## 📖 Project Overview
Traditional cybersecurity detection often relies on known "signatures." This project takes a **Behavioral Analysis** approach using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm. By analyzing features like login frequency and session duration, the model identifies "outliers" that deviate significantly from the norm—potential indicators of credential stuffing, account takeover, or insider threats.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Unsupervised Learning:** No target labels required. The model learns what "normal" looks like on its own.
- **Dynamic Feature Selection:** Automatically identifies high-variance features to focus on the most informative data points.
- **Interactive Visualizations:**
    - **Decision Boundaries:** See exactly where the model draws the line between safe and suspicious.
    - **SHAP Integration:** Explainable AI (XAI) that tells you *why* a specific user session was flagged.
- **Real-time Analytics:** Instant metrics on anomaly percentages and severity scores.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** Python 3.10+
- **ML Framework:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
- **Explainability:** SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
- **UI/Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
